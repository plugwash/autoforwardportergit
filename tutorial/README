autoforwardportergit tutorial.

This tutorial will demonstrate the use of the autoforwardporter. 
For demonstration purposes we will use a demonstration repository as our 
downstream distribution and Debian as our upstream distribution. We will
assume that you have cloned the autoforwardportergit repository into 
~/autoforwardportergit

---installing dependencies---

This is the only step that requires root privilages. All remaining steps

apt-get install git dgit python3 python3-debian python3-git moreutils rcs quilt reprepro python3-bs4

---Preparing the "old version" of the demonstration package---

cd ~/autoforwardportergit/tutorial
